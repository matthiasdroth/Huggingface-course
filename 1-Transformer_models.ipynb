    "Here is a brief overview of the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center\" width=\"90%\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/summary.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 1 to 4 provide an introduction to the main concepts of the 🤗 Transformers library. By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the Hugging Face Hub, fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!\n",
    "- Chapters 5 to 8 teach the basics of 🤗 Datasets and 🤗 Tokenizers before diving into classic NLP tasks. By the end of this part, you will be able to tackle the most common NLP problems by yourself.\n",
    "- Chapters 9 to 12 go beyond NLP, and explore how Transformer models can be used tackle tasks in speech processing and computer vision. Along the way, you'll learn how to build and share demos of your models, and optimize them for production environments. By the end of this part, you will be ready to apply 🤗 Transformers to (almost) any machine learning problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Natural language processing](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/2?fw=pt)\n",
    "Before jumping into Transformer models, let’s do a quick overview of what natural language processing is and why we care about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n",
    "- Classifying whole sentences: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\n",
    "- Classifying each word in a sentence: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\n",
    "- Generating text content: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "- Extracting an answer from a text: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",
    "- Generating a new sentence from an input text: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn't limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it challenging?\n",
    "Computers don't process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence \"I am hungry,\" we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as \"I am hungry\" and \"I am sad,\" we're able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Transformers, what can they do?](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt)\n",
    "In this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the 🤗 Transformers library: the `pipeline()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers are everywhere!\n",
    "Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center\" width=\"95%\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/organizations.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The 🤗 Transformers library provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The Model Hub contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ The Hugging Face Hub is not limited to Transformer models. Anyone can share any kind of models or datasets they want! [Create a huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) account to benefit from all available features!\n",
    "\n",

This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don't have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You've already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."

    "### A bit of Transformer history\n",
    "Here are some reference points in the (short) history of Transformer models:\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center\" width=\"80%\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/transformers_chrono.svg\">\n",
    "The [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
    "- **June 2018**: [GPT](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf), the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
    "- **October 2018**: [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
    "- **February 2019**: [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
    "- **October 2019**: [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT's performance\n",
    "- **October 2019**: [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)\n",
    "- **May 2020**, [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called *zero-shot learning*)\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "- GPT-like (also called *auto-regressive* Transformer models)\n",
    "- BERT-like (also called *auto-encoding* Transformer models)\n",
    "- BART/T5-like (also called *sequence-to-sequence* Transformer models)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive into these families in more depth later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers are language models\n",
    "All the Transformer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been trained as *language models*. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it's not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called *transfer learning*. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the *n* previous words. This is called *causal language modeling* because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center\" width=\"80%\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/causal_modeling.svg\">\n",
    "Another example is *masked language modeling*, in which the model predicts a masked word in the sentence.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center\" width=\"70%\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/masked_modeling.svg\">\n",
    "### Transformers are big models\n",

To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model, then perform additional training with a dataset specific to your task. Wait — why not simply train directly for the final task? There are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "- The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).\n",
    "- Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning requires way less data to get decent results.\n",
    "- For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is \"transferred\", hence the term *transfer learning*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a model therefore has lower time, data, financial, and environmental costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes, as the training is less constraining than a full pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model — one as close as possible to the task you have at hand — and fine-tune it.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The model is primarily composed of two blocks:\n",
    "- **Encoder (left)**: The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
    "- **Decoder (right)**: The decoder uses the encoder's representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/transformers_blocks.svg\">\n",
    "Each of these parts can be used independently, depending on the task:\n",
    "- **Encoder-only models**: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.\n",
    "- **Decoder-only models**: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.\n",
    "- **Encoder-decoder models** or **sequence-to-sequence models**: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.\n",
    "We will dive into those architectures independently in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention layers\n",
    "A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called *attention layers*. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was [“Attention Is All You Need”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)! We will explore the details of attention layers later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input \"You like this course\", a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word “You” to get the proper translation for the word \"like\", because in French the verb \"like\" is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating \"this\" the model will also need to pay attention to the word \"course\", because \"this\" translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of \"this\". With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of what attention layers are all about, let's take a closer look at the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The original architecture\n",
    "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer architecture looked like this, with the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right:\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"sections/section_1/images/transformers.svg\">\n",
    "Note that the the first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *attention mask* can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words — for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectures vs. checkpoints\n",
    "As we dive into Transformer models in this course, you'll see mentions of *architectures* and *checkpoints* as well as *models*. These terms all have slightly different meanings:\n",
    "- **Architecture**: This is the skeleton of the model — the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "- **Checkpoints**: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
    "- **Model**: This is an umbrella term that isn't as precise as \"architecture\" or \"checkpoint\": it can mean both. This course will specify *architecture* or *checkpoint* when it matters to reduce ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, BERT is an architecture while `bert-base-cased`, a set of weights trained by the Google team for the first release of BERT, is a checkpoint. However, one can say \"the BERT model\" and \"the `bert-base-cased` model.\"\n",
