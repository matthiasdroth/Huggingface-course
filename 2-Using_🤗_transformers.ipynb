    "# Using ü§ó transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Introduction](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/1?fw=pt)\n",
    "As you saw in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), Transformer models are usually very large. With millions to tens of *billions* of parameters, training and deploying these models is a complicated undertaking. Furthermore, with new models being released on a near-daily basis and each having its own implementation, trying them all out is no easy task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ü§ó Transformers library was created to solve this problem. Its goal is to provide a single API through which any Transformer model can be loaded, trained, and saved. The library's main features are:\n",
    "- **Ease of use**: Downloading, loading, and using a state-of-the-art NLP model for inference can be done in just two lines of code.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: At their core, all models are simple PyTorch `nn.Module` or TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model` classes and can be handled like any other models in their respective machine learning (ML) frameworks.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Hardly any abstractions are made across the library. The \"All in one file\" is a core concept: a model's forward pass is entirely defined in a single file, so that the code itself is understandable and hackable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last feature makes ü§ó Transformers quite different from other ML libraries. The models are not built on modules that are shared across files; instead, each model has its own layers. In addition to making the models more approachable and understandable, this allows you to easily experiment on one model without affecting others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will begin with an end-to-end example where we use a model and a tokenizer together to replicate the `pipeline()` function introduced in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1). Next, we'll discuss the model API: we'll dive into the model and configuration classes, and show you how to load a model and how it processes numerical inputs to output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll look at the tokenizer API, which is the other main component of the `pipeline()` function. Tokenizers take care of the first and last processing steps, handling the conversion from text to numerical inputs for the neural network, and the conversion back to text when it is needed. Finally, we'll show you how to handle sending multiple sentences through a model in a prepared batch, then wrap it all up with a closer look at the high-level `tokenizer()` function.\n",

    "### Preprocessing with a tokenizer\n",
    "Like other neural networks, Transformer models can't process raw text directly, so the first step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a *tokenizer*, which will be responsible for:\n",
    "- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called tokens.\n",
    "- Mapping each token to an integer.\n",
    "- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model.\n",

To do this, we use the `AutoTokenizer` class and its `from_pretrained()` method. Using the checkpoint name of our model, it will automatically fetch the data associated with the model's tokenizer and cache it (so it's only downloaded the first time you run the code below).\n",

Furthermore, words like \"dog\" are represented differently from words like \"dogs\", and the model will initially have no way of knowing that \"dog\" and \"dogs\" are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated.

If you've ever worked with tensors before, you know that they need to be of rectangular shape, so you won't be able to convert the list of input IDs into a tensor directly.

    "### Longer sequences\n",
    "With Transformer models, there is a limit to the lengths of the sequences we can pass the models. Most models handle sequences of up to 512 or 1024 tokens, and will crash when asked to process longer sequences. There are two solutions to this problem:\n",
    "- Use a model with a longer supported sequence length.\n",
    "- Truncate your sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models have different supported sequence lengths, and some specialize in handling very long sequences. [Longformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html) is one example, and another is [LED](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/led.html). If you're working on a task that requires very long sequences, we recommend you take a look at those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we recommend you truncate your sequences by specifying the `max_sequence_length` parameter:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sequence = sequence[:max_sequence_length]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Putting it all together](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/6?fw=pt)\n",
    "In the last few sections, we've been trying our best to do most of the work by hand. We've explored how tokenizers work and looked at tokenization, conversion to input IDs, padding, truncation, and attention masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we saw in section 2, the ü§ó Transformers API can handle all of this for us with a high-level function that we'll dive into here. When you call your `tokenizer` directly on the sentence, you get back inputs that are ready to pass through your model:"
