    "## [Training a causal language model from scratch](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6?fw=pt)\n",
    "Up until now, we've mostly been using pretrained models and fine-tuning them for new use cases by reusing the weights from pretraining. As we saw in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), this is commonly referred to as *transfer learning*, and it's a very successful strategy for applying Transformer models to most real-world use cases where labeled data is sparse. In this chapter, we'll take a different approach and train a completely new model from scratch. This is a good approach to take if you have a lot of data and it is very different from the pretraining data used for the available models. However, it also requires considerably more compute resources to pretrain a language model than just to fine-tune an existing one. Examples where it can make sense to train a new model include for datasets consisting of musical notes, molecular sequences such as DNA, or programming languages. The latter have recently gained traction thanks to tools such as TabNine and GitHub's Copilot, powered by OpenAI's Codex model, that can generate long sequences of code. This task of text generation is best addressed with auto-regressive or causal language models such as GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will build a scaled-down version of a code generation model: we'll focus on one-line completions instead of full functions or classes, using a subset of Python code. When working with data in Python you are in frequent contact with the Python data science stack, consisting of the `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. When using those frameworks it's common to need to look up specific commands, so it would be nice if we could use a model to complete these calls for us."

Using a GitHub dump of about 180 GB containing roughly 20 million Python files called `codeparrot`, the authors built a dataset that they then shared on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/transformersbook/codeparrot).\n",

So, let's start by filtering the `codeparrot` dataset for all files that include any of the libraries in this stack. Because of the dataset's size, we want to avoid downloading it; instead, we'll use the streaming feature to filter it on the fly. To help us filter the code samples using the libraries we mentioned earlier, we'll use the following function:"

If it is important for your application to have more context (for example, if you want the model to write unit tests based on a file with the function definition), make sure you increase that number, but also keep in mind that this comes with a greater GPU memory footprint.

For reference, OpenAI's GPT-3 and Codex models are trained on 300 and 100 billion tokens, respectively, where the Codex models are initialized from the GPT-3 checkpoints.

    "> ✏️ Try it out! <font color=\"darkgreen\">Getting rid of all the chunks that are smaller than the context size wasn't a big issue here because we're using small context windows. As you increase the context size (or if you have a corpus of short documents), the fraction of chunks that are thrown away will also grow. A more efficient way to prepare the data is to join all the tokenized samples in a batch with an `eos_token_id` token in between, and then perform the chunking on the concatenated sequences. As an exercise, modify the `tokenize()` function to make use of that approach. Note that you'll want to set `truncation=False` and remove the other arguments from the tokenizer to get the full sequence of token IDs.\n",

Sometimes it requires more customization of the model training to achieve the necessary performance for a given use case, however. For example, what if we would like to dynamically update the batch size or have a conditional training loop that skips bad examples on the fly? One option would be to subclass the `Trainer` and add the necessary changes, but sometimes it's simpler to write the training loop from scratch. That's where 🤗 Accelerate comes in.\n",

If these are each represented as a single token, we can easily check if they occur in the input sequence. Tokens can have a whitespace prefix, so we’ll also check for those versions in the tokenizer vocabulary. To verify that it works, we’ll add one test token which should be split into multiple tokens:"

    "Great, that seems to work nicely! We can now write a custom loss function that takes the input sequence, the logits, and the key tokens we just selected as inputs. First, we need to align the logits and inputs: the input sequence shifted by one to the right forms the labels, since the next token is the label for the current token. We can achieve this by starting the labels from the second token of the input sequence, since the model does not make a prediction for the first token anyway. Then we cut off the last logit, as we don't have a label for the token that follows the full input sequence. With that we can compute the loss per sample and count the occurrences of all keywords in each sample. Finally, we calculate the weighted average over all samples using the occurrences as weights. Since we don't want to throw away all the samples that have no keywords, we add `1` to the weights:"
