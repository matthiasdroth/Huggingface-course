    "## [Introduction](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/1?fw=pt)\n",
    "In [Chapter 3](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter3), you saw how to fine-tune a model for text classification. In this chapter, we will tackle the following common NLP tasks:\n",
    "- Token classification\n",
    "- Masked language modeling (like BERT)\n",
    "- Summarization\n",
    "- Translation\n",
    "- Causal language modeling pretraining (like GPT-2)\n",
    "- Question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you'll need to leverage everything you learned about the `Trainer` API and the 🤗 Accelerate library in [Chapter 3](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter3), the 🤗 Datasets library in [Chapter 5](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter5), and the 🤗 Tokenizers library in [Chapter 6](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6). We'll also upload our results to the Model Hub, like we did in [Chapter 4](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4), so this is really the chapter where everything comes together!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section can be read independently and will show you how to train a model with the `Trainer` API or with your own training loop, using 🤗 Accelerate. Feel free to skip either part and focus on the one that interests you the most: the `Trainer` API is great for fine-tuning or training your model without worrying about what's going on behind the scenes, while the training loop with `Accelerate` will let you customize any part you want more easily.\n",
    "> <font color=\"darkgreen\">If you read the sections in sequence, you will notice that they have quite a bit of code and prose in common. The repetition is intentional, to allow you to dip in (or come back later) to any task that interests you and find a complete working example.</font>"
